# Solving Coloring Problems on Bipartite Graphs Using Linear Algebra

Repository of my master thesis "Solving Coloring Problems on Bipartite Graphs Using Linear Algebra".

## How to use

To use the programs, the C library SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS must be installed. Installation instructions can be found in the following Github repository: https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS

The programs can be compiled using the instructions in the comment section at the beginning of each program.

## graphblas-programms

This folder contains the implementations of d-1 and d-2 coloring for different graphs. 

## graph-plots

This folder contains the implementations of the d-1 and d-2 colorings and the corresponding Python wrappers, which plot the graphs using the Python package NetworkX.

## evaluation

This folder contains the implementations of d-1 and d-2 coloring with randomly generated graphs with 10, 20, 40 and 80 nodes. The programs calculate the required number of colors and the runtimes of the programs can be measured. 


## program-code-for-latex

This folder contains the files that are used in the text and appendix of the master thesis.
